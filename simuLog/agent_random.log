Now you get the basic information for passenger requests and taxi vehicles, respectively. Their positions are represented as [longitude, latitude].
The passenger requests are as follows:
{
  "79770": {
    "destination": [104.0202519, 30.6895784],
    "distance_to_taxis": {

  },
  "80899": {

    "distance_to_taxis": {
      "10": 1687.66
    },
    "expected_travel_distance": 9315.96,
    "expected_travel_time": 621.06,
    "origin": [104.060944, 30.6076951],

  },
  "81047": {
    "destination": [104.0962794, 30.7083293],

    "expected_travel_distance": 1656.46,
    "expected_travel_time": 110.43,
    "origin": [104.1119439, 30.7146842],
    "state": "searching for available vehicles"
  }
}	,where the key is the `request id`, and its value represents its ideal pickup position and drop-off position.
The taxi vehicles are as follows:
{
  0: {
    "position": [104.0929301, 30.652499]
  },
  1: {
    "position": [104.0717077, 30.6652913]
  },
  3: {
    "position": [104.0850985, 30.6558598]
  },
  6: {
    "position": [104.069545, 30.6578636]
  },
  8: {
    "position": [104.0808192, 30.6621508]
  },
  10: {
    "current_requests": {
      "81088": {
        "destination": [104.0738543, 30.6970738],
        "origin": [104.0562247, 30.6223237],
        "state": "picked up, waiting for arrival at destination"
      }
    },
    "position": [104.0562247, 30.6223237]
  },
  14: {
    "position": [104.0595156, 30.6438068]
  }
}	,where the key is the `taxi id`, and its value represents the taxi's current position and any already assigned passenger on it.
