Important Notes:
- Ensure you consider all given information before making final decisions.
- Don't omit any passengers; each passenger must have an assignment (even if it's "-1").
- Provide concise reasons explaining why each assignment is the best choice.
- Make sure to evaluate the complete decision space before finalizing assignments.
- Consider the impact of each assignment on the overall system efficiency.

Additional Considerations:
- The distance between taxi and passenger is a crucial factor but not the only one.
- Consider the geographical distribution of both passengers and taxis.
- Ensure fair distribution of services while maintaining efficiency.

Remember:
1. Process all information systematically before making decisions.
2. Each taxi can serve only one passenger.
3. Use "-1" for unassigned passengers.
4. Provide clear, logical reasoning for each assignment.
