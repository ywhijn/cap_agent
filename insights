  {"u_id": 79438, "v_id": 10, "reason": "Taxi 10 is the closest to passenger 79438 among all available taxis."},
  {"u_id": 80333, "v_id": 10, "reason": "Passenger 80333 cannot be assigned as taxi 10 is already being considered for another passenger and no other suitable taxis are in the decision space."}
] 

Note: The second assignment is incorrect based on the rules provided. Since Taxi ID 10 has been assigned to Passenger 79438, it cannot also be assigned to Passenger 80333. Therefore, Passenger 80333 should not have a valid taxi assignment.

Corrected response:

[
  {"u_id": 79438, "v_id": 10, "reason": "Taxi 10 is the closest and available for passenger 79438."},
  {"u_id": 80333, "v_id": -1, "reason": "No suitable taxi found in decision space that can serve this passenger without violating the rule of not assigning over 2 passengers to a single taxi."}
