At step 1207, you get the basic information for passenger requests and taxi vehicles, respectively. Their positions are represented as [longitude, latitude].
The passenger requests are as follows:

  }
}       , where `key` is the `passenger ID`, and `distance_to_taxis` field with 'taxi ID: distance(meter)' dict represents the estimated distance to the taxi vehicles in the decision space.
The taxi vehicles are as follows:

For the current step, you get the decision space for taxis, where the key is the `taxi ID` and the value is possibly a list of `passenger ID` within the suitable service area of the taxi.

You must follow the rules:
1. Don't finish the task until you have a final answer. Make sure you have considered all the given information.
2. Assume passengers and drivers are willing to participate in ride-sharing for environmental and cost-saving reasons. But we cannot assign over 2 passengers to a single taxi
3. If all taxi drivers are unavailable to a certain passenger, you must assign that passenger to a special taxi ID -1, which means the order is NOT assigned to any taxi driver. Provide a clear explanation for why the assignment couldn't be made.

Please assign passengers to taxi drivers according to the given rules and information. 
Provide your response only in the following json format without extra words:
