Based on the distances and travel times calculated, here are the assignments for the passenger requests:

1. **Request 78942**:
   - **Driver 17**: Distance: 2116.4 meters, Time: 141.09 seconds
   - **Driver 12**: Distance: 1589.92 meters, Time: 105.99 seconds

   **Assignment**: Driver 12 is closer and will take less time to reach the pickup location. Assign Request 78942 to Driver 12.

2. **Request 81088**:
   - **Driver 17**: Distance: 6329.67 meters, Time: 421.98 seconds
   - **Driver 12**: Distance: 5549.19 meters, Time: 369.95 seconds

   **Assignment**: Driver 12 is also closer for this request and will take less time to reach the pickup location. Assign Request 81088 to Driver 12.

**Final Assignments**:
- Request 78942 to Driver 12
- Request 81088 to Driver 12

Given these assignments, Driver 12 will handle both requests, optimizing travel time and distance for both passengers.
