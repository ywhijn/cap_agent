[32;1m[1;3mTo begin the task of assigning passenger requests to taxi vehicles, we need to calculate the distances and travel times between the pickup locations of the passengers and the current positions of the taxis. This will help us determine which taxi is the most suitable for each request based on proximity and availability.

Let's start by calculating the distance and travel time for the first passenger request (request id "78942") to each of the taxi vehicles.

### Step 1: Calculate Distance and Travel Time for Request "78942"

**Request "78942" Details:**
- Origin: [104.0412682, 30.6669185]
- Destination: [104.1438647, 30.6276377]

**Taxi Vehicles Details:**
- Taxi "57": [104.0514075, 30.6770349]
- Taxi "10": [104.0681124, 30.6658005]
- Taxi "16": [104.0624488, 30.6747592]
- Taxi "42": [104.0514075, 30.6770349]
- Taxi "22": [104.0456417, 30.6216829]
- Taxi "32": [104.0555226, 30.647909]
- Taxi "48": [104.0578463, 30.6739725]
- Taxi "12": [104.0631067, 30.6713975]
- Taxi "49": [104.0681124, 30.6658005]
- Taxi "66": [104.0505674, 30.6844898]
- Taxi "56": [104.0498145, 30.676688]
- Taxi "4": [104.0485473, 30.6657565]

**Action for Taxi "57":**

TOOLS:

You have access to the following tools:


Get Distance and Travel Time: Useful when you want to know the distance and travel time between two locations. The input to this tool should be the origin and destination location tuples (longitude, latitude) within a list, like '[(104.0256898, 30.6401228), (30.6392765, 104.0704372)]'.

The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).
The only values that should be in the "action" field are one of: Get Distance and Travel Time

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. **Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB**:
```

  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT

You have access to the following tools:


Get Distance and Travel Time: Useful when you want to know the distance and travel time between two locations. The input to this tool should be a list, whose elements are two positions in format of [longitude, latitude].

The only values that should be in the "action" field are one of: Get Distance and Travel Time
