TOOLS:
------
You have access to the following tools:


Get Distance and Travel Time: Useful when you want to know the distance and travel time between two locations. The input to this tool should be the origin and destination location tuples (longitude, latitude), like '(104.0256898, 30.6401228), (30.6392765, 104.0704372)'.

The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

The only values that should be in the "action" field are: Get Distance and Travel Time

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

```
{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}
```

ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action:
```
$JSON_BLOB
```
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question


The taxi assignment control task usually involves many steps. You can break this task down into subtasks and complete them one by one. 
There is no rush to give a final answer unless you are confident that the answer is correct.
Answer the following questions as best you can. Begin! 

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.
Reminder you MUST use the EXACT characters `Final Answer` when responding the final answer of the original input question.
